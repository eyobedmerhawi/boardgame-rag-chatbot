## Enhancements

- Implemented Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline
- Added semantic search with ChromaDB and Sentence Transformers
- Generated grounded responses using Groq LLMs
- Extended support from 8 to 9 board games by adding Connect 4
- Re-indexed vector database and validated retrieval across custom rulebooks

# 🎲 RulesBot

> A board game rules assistant — because "just read the rulebook" isn't always helpful at 11pm on game night.

RulesBot answers natural language questions about board game rules using a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) pipeline. Ask it anything: it retrieves relevant rule passages and generates an answer grounded in the actual text.

**This is a starter repo.** The UI and infrastructure are built. The retrieval and generation pipeline is yours to implement.

## Getting Started

### 1. Fork and clone

Fork this repo, then clone your fork locally.

### 2. Create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate      # Mac/Linux
# or: .venv\Scripts\activate   # Windows
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

> **Note:** `sentence-transformers` will download the embedding model (~80MB) on first run. This only happens once — it's cached locally afterward.

### 4. Add your Groq API key

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and replace `your_key_here` with your key from [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com). No credit card required.

### 5. Run the app

```bash
python app.py
```

RulesBot will start and open in your browser. Before you implement the retrieval pipeline, it will load and display the UI but won't be able to answer questions.

## Where to Start

Before opening any `.py` file, read `specs/system-design.md`. It explains what's built, what's left for you, and why the technical decisions were made. Each milestone then begins by completing the corresponding spec file before writing code — that spec becomes the brief you hand to your AI tool when you're ready to implement.

## Re-ingesting After Changes

ChromaDB persists to disk in `./chroma_db`. If you change your chunking strategy and want to re-ingest, delete that folder and restart the app:

```bash
rm -rf chroma_db/   # Mac/Linux
# or: rmdir /s chroma_db   # Windows
python app.py
```
